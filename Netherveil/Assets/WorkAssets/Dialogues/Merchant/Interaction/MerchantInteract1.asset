  dialogue: You might wonder who am I ? I am the greatest, the magnificent, the wonderful,
    the best of all the merchants of this earth. I wander around these places, in
    this <color=red>infinite dungeon</color>, just to find any new product I could
    put in my stall, to become the <color=red>ultimate</color> merchant with the
    most exclusive items!
