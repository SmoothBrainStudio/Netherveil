  dialogue: "I imagine you just came from a <color=#ff499e>portal</color> too ? I
    don\u2019t understand yet how they really work, but with some help and research,
    I have a theory from my own and incredible mind. Each <color=#ff499e>portal</color>
    gives the possibility to this dungeon to be infinite, by reorganizing itself
    at any time. I just know that some rare <color=#ff499e>portals</color> are linked
    to a point outside in the world that corruption wants to reach."
