  dialogue: Each time you get <color=#8338ec>corruption</color> <sprite name="corruption">,
    from quests <sprite name="quest"> or fountains, your progress bar will increase
    and reach tiers. Thus, these will impact your body. Each tier, you'll become
    very strong, gaining some strength against <color=#8338ec>monsters</color> <sprite
    name="ziggo"> and healing each time you kill one of 'em, but you'll need to sacrifice
    some of your <color=#a4161a>life</color> and <color=#2c7da0>defense</color>.
    No worries, you'll be so strong you don't need that hehe!
